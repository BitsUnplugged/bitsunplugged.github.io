The challenge is to move the entire stack of disks from one peg to another, with the following rules: \n <font size='5'>1\\. Only one disk can be moved at a time. \n 2\\. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. \n 3\\. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. \n 4\\. The goal is to move all the disks from the starting peg to the destination peg, using the spare peg as an intermediary, adhering to the above rules.</font>",
