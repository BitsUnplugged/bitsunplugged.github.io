The challenge is to move the entire stack of disks from one peg to another, with the following rules: \n <font size='5'>1\\. Only one disk can be moved at a time. \n 2\\. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. \n 3\\. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. \n 4\\. The goal is to move all the disks from the starting peg to the destination peg, using the spare peg as an intermediary, adhering to the above rules.</font>",

Initially, all three disks are stacked on rod A, with the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest at the top. \n Move Disk 1 to Rod C: Start by moving the smallest disk (disk 1) from rod A to rod C. This is the only move possible for the smallest disk. \n Move Disk 2 to Rod B: Next, move the second smallest disk (disk 2) from rod A to rod B. Since we cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller one, disk 2 must be placed on rod B. \n Move Disk 1 to Rod B: Now, move the smallest disk (disk 1) from rod C to rod B. This completes the transfer of disks 1 and 2 to rod B, with disk 2 being the largest on rod B. \n Move Disk 3 to Rod C: Move the largest disk (disk 3) from rod A to rod C. Since disk 3 is larger than disks 1 and 2, it can be placed on rod C without violating the rules. \n Move Disk 1 to Rod A: Now, move disk 1 from rod B to rod A. This step ensures that disk 1 is positioned on rod A, allowing us to move disk 2 onto disk 3 in the next step. \n Move Disk 2 to Rod C: Finally, move disk 2 from rod B to rod C. Since disk 2 is smaller than disk 3, it can be placed on top of disk 3 without violating the rules.\n Move Disk 1 to Rod C: Optionally, move disk 1 from rod A to rod C. This step is not necessary to complete the Tower of Hanoi with 3 disks, but it can be performed if you want to return all disks to rod C..",
